A port of the popular todo.txt-cli project written in bash to python.

This branch does NOT require GitPython.

Enjoy, contribute, and feel free to clone. I'm doing this blind[1] as best as
possible for fun.

[1] By blind, I mean without looking at the source of the original todo.txt-cli
project. I'm working solely from my experiences with the script and
experimenting with the functionality while adding things I should probably write
as patches and send upstream... I'll wait to finish my version of the project
first though.
